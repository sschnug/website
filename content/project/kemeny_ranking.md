### Summary
This is an efficient MIP-formulation of the Kemeny Score Rank Aggregation problem, which might also
serve as additional documentation/example for the usage of [cylp](https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP) (which has very sparse documentation).

More information is available at the project-page.
