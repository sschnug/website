### Summary
This is an LP-formulation for the Footrule Score Rank Aggregation problem, which might also
serve as additional documentation/example for the usage of [cylp](https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP) (which has very sparse documentation). It's somewhat comparable to my [kemeny_ranking](http://github.com/sschnug/kemeny_ranking) project, but instead of Mixed-integer programming, Linear-programming is used. It's also less optimized in terms of model-creation.

More information is available at the project-page.
